# About Me
## Hi There, my name is Randy Sawatzky.  I am originally form Winnipeg but have lived in Calgary since 2005.  I worked as VP Operations for a pet supply company for 17 years. I have since taken a role as business analyst, database administrator and inventory control manager for a company that has stakes in Pet stores, ecommerce and Veterinary hospitals. I spend most of my day working in Java, Python and SQL Server.  In February 2023 I started a great course at the University of Alberta in Full Stack Web Development.  I am on track for earning my diploma by late fall 2024 with a 4.0 GPA.
