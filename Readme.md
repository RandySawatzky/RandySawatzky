# About Me
Hello there! My name is Randy Sawatzky. I hail from Winnipeg but have been residing in Calgary since 2005.

I have a rich professional background, having served as the VP Operations for a pet supply company for 17 years. Currently, I am employed as a business analyst, database administrator, and inventory control manager for a diversified company. This company has interests in pet stores, veterinary hospitals, and a burgeoning ecommerce business.

My daily work involves extensive use of Java, Python, and SQL Server.

In February 2023, I embarked on an exciting journey of learning by enrolling in a Full Stack Web Development course at the University of Alberta. I am on track to earn my diploma by late fall 2024, and Iâ€™m proud to share that I have maintained a 4.0 GPA throughout this course.
